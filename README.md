I am Danai Roumelioti. 
I am from Greece and I have a bachelor's degree in Computer Science from National and Kapodistrian University of Athens.

I am a first year PhD student and this is my first year in Drexel University.
I want to learn and understand what a Software Architect is and does and also to become familiar with modern programming languages and obtain the ability to work as a fullstack developer in the future if I decide to do so.
